### Chrome extension CORS (container + Dokploy/Traefik)

If you call `/capture` from a Chrome extension and receive `Failed to fetch`, you can enable CORS directly in the
Pixashot container, then optionally keep Traefik labels in Dokploy.

1. Enable CORS in the Pixashot service:

```bash
CORS_ENABLED=true
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=chrome-extension://<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>
CORS_ALLOWED_METHODS=GET,POST,OPTIONS
CORS_ALLOWED_HEADERS=Content-Type,Authorization
```

2. (Optional) Add Traefik middleware labels in Dokploy if you still want CORS handled at the proxy layer:

```yaml
labels:
  - "traefik.http.routers.<router>-web.middlewares=redirect-to-https@file,cors-headers"
  - "traefik.http.routers.<router>-websecure.middlewares=cors-headers"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.cors-headers.headers.accesscontrolalloworiginlist=chrome-extension://<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.cors-headers.headers.accesscontrolallowmethods=POST,OPTIONS"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.cors-headers.headers.accesscontrolallowheaders=Content-Type"
  - "traefik.http.middlewares.cors-headers.headers.addvaryheader=true"
```

3. Save and redeploy, then validate preflight handling:

```bash
curl -i -X OPTIONS \
  -H "Origin: chrome-extension://<YOUR_EXTENSION_ID>" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Method: POST" \
  -H "Access-Control-Request-Headers: content-type" \
  http://<your-domain>/capture
```

You should receive a `200`/`204` response with `Access-Control-*` headers. If preflight still fails and the response has
`Server: nginx`, your platform may be intercepting `OPTIONS` before Traefik middleware is applied; in that case,
container-level CORS remains the most reliable fallback.

## 💰 Cost Efficiency

- **Optimized Resource Usage**: Efficient use of CPU and memory, especially with the single browser context
  architecture.
- **Stateless Design**: Enables horizontal scaling and cost-effective use of cloud resources.
- **Google Cloud Run Free Tier**: Deploying on Google Cloud Run allows you to leverage their generous free tier:
    - 2 million requests/month
    - 360,000 vCPU-seconds
    - 180,000 GiB-seconds
    - Many users can operate within the free tier limits.
